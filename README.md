#  cnvrg AI Library: Slack integration

send a custom message to a slack channel using incoming webhook

## How It Works

1. create a slack app: [](https://api.slack.com/apps)[https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)

2. activate incoming webhooks

3. install to workspace & choose channel to post to

4. copy webhook URL

## Running

Define the slack incoming webhook URL as a secret in your cnvrg project:
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
```

Running the application with the `-h` option yields the following usage message:
```
python3 main.py -h
```
The command yields the following usage message:
```
usage: main.py [-h]  --sometxt SOMETXT
                                       [--sometxt SOMETXT]
                                     

Options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
 
```
